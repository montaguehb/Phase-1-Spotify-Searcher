# Phase-1-Spotify-Searcher

This is a simple single-page javascript app that can be used to preview songs from pre-set playlists, filtered by genre. It also allows you to search by a number of different fields and returns the top 10 results; adding the preview for them onto the page. As there is no login, a user would need to provide their own client secret and client ID

## Installation

The code runs natively without the need to install anything. Navigate to the directory and run the following command to open the file.

Mac/*nix

```bash
open ./index.html
```

Windows

```bash
explorer.exe ./index.html
```

## Usage

The site has a couple of features, most of which are listed below

* Clicking on any of the nav elements will grab 10 songs from a pre-set playlist and add them to the page with a preview and a link to the track.
* You can search for a specific song by title or click the advanced search to find one by other information like artist.
* Mousing over the header will randomly change the color of the text.
